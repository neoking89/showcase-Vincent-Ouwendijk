This folder contains 3 files: a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, and 2 WAV-files.
"beyonce_sample" contains an accapella of the popular singer Beyonce.
This is used as input for the .ipynb-file "Recreate first partial of Beyonce's voice".
This .ipynb-file contains a selfmade algorithm which attempts to recreate the first partial of Beyonce's voice through additive synthesis and filtering.
"first_partial_result.wav" is the endresult of the algorithm.

Without getting too technical, I would advice to first listen to "beyonce_sample.wav" and then "first_partial_result.wav" to hear a direct comparison between the two.
